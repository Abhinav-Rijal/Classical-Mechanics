Solution of the differential equation of orbit of a planet around a star under different force laws using RK4 method.
We can observe that the orbit becomes elliptical for inver square law force, and the planet collides spirally for higher orders of inverse central forces; the orbit gets shorter and shorter and collision happens faster.
